# This application uses both heavily templated classes and functions as well as dynamically allocations and run-time 
features in order to create very efficient and fast generic containers for user inputs.

# The heart of the the program is based on creating recursively generic nodes and doubly linkeing them. 
This is mainoy done based on template metaprogramming techniques.

# The program not only accepts built-in C++ types as user input, but also any kind of complicated user-defined types too, 
which make it very unique and
